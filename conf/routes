# Routes
# This file defines all application routes (Higher priority routes first)
# ~~~~

# The following 3 routes are from the tutorial

# Home page
GET     /                           controllers.Application.index()

# This is an endpoint for creating a person
POST    /person                     controllers.Application.addPerson()

# This is an endpoint for listing persons (This is a JSON endpoint)
GET     /persons                    controllers.Application.getPersons()



# Our first attempt at creating some Blog routes
# here we have nice route names, but all of our actions are in the
# Application controller. If we keep adding all of our routes to a single
# controller, then our code will become unmanageable as it grows.
#GET     /blogs                      controllers.Application.listBlogs()
#GET     /blogs/new                  controllers.Application.newBlog()
#POST    /blogs                      controllers.Application.createBlog()
#GET     /blogs/:id                  controllers.Application.showBlog(id: Long)





# Restful Routes Example
# We allow some CRUD operations on Resources
# You are free to name them as you like. But it is important to be consistent
# and descriptive.
GET     /people                     controllers.People.index()
GET     /people/new                 controllers.People.form()
GET     /people/:id                 controllers.People.show(id: Long)
DELETE  /people/:id                 controllers.People.delete(id: Long)
GET     /people/:id/edit            controllers.People.edit(id: Long)
PUT     /people/:id                 controllers.People.update(id: Long)
POST    /people                     controllers.People.create()


# A blog as mocked up in week 1.
# Here I created a separate Blog controller to manage the Action methods of
# my applications Blogging feature.

GET     /blogs/:id                  controllers.Blog.show(id: Long)
